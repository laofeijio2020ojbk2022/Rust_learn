## Codegen Rewrite

The [`rocket_codegen`] crate has been entirely rewritten using to-be-stable
procedural macro APIs. We expect nightly breakages to drop dramatically, likely
to zero, as a result. The new prelude import for Rocket applications is:

```diff
- #![feature(plugin)]
- #![plugin(rocket_codegen)]
+ #![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

- extern crate rocket;
+ #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
```

The [`rocket_codegen`] crate should **_not_** be a direct dependency. Remove it
from your `Cargo.toml`:

```diff
[dependencies]
- rocket = "0.3"
+ rocket = "0.4"
- rocket_codegen = "0.3"
```

[`rocket_codegen`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4/rocket_codegen/index.html

## Breaking Changes

This release includes many breaking changes. These changes are listed below
along with a short note about how to handle the breaking change in existing
applications when applicable.

  * **Route and catcher attributes respect function privacy.**

    To mount a route or register a catcher outside of the module it is declared,
    ensure that the handler function is marked `pub` or `crate`.

  * **Query handling syntax has been completely revamped.**

    A query parameter of `<param>` is now `<param..>`. Consider whether your
    application benefits from the revamped [query string handling].

  * **The `#[error]` attribute and `errors!` macro were removed.**

    Use `#[catch]` and `catchers!` instead.

  * **`Rocket::catch()` was renamed to [`Rocket::register()`].**

    Change calls of the form `.catch(errors![..])` to
    `.register(catchers![..])`.

  * **The `#[catch]` attribute only accepts functions with 0 or 1 argument.**

    Ensure the argument to the catcher, if any, is of type `&Request`.

  * **[`json!`] returns a [`JsonValue`], no longer needs wrapping.**

    Change instances of `Json(json!(..))` to `json!` and change the
    corresponding type to `JsonValue`.

  * **All environments default to port 8000.**

    Manually configure a port of `80` for the `stage` and `production`
    environments for the previous behavior.

  * **Release builds default to the production environment.**

    Manually set the environment to `debug` with `ROCKET_ENV=debug` for the
    previous behavior.

  * **[`Form`] and [`LenientForm`] lost a lifetime parameter, `get()` method.**

    Change a type of `Form<'a, T<'a>>` to `Form<T>` or `Form<T<'a>>`. `Form<T>`
    and `LenientForm<T>` now implement `Deref<Target = T>`, allowing for calls
    to `.get()` to be removed.

  * **[`ring`] was updated to 0.13.**

    Ensure all transitive dependencies to `ring` refer to version `0.13`.

  * **`Uri` was largely replaced by [`Origin`].**

    In general, replace the type `Uri` with `Origin`. The `base` and `uri`
    fields of [`Route`] are now of type [`Origin`]. The `&Uri` guard is now
    `&Origin`. [`Request::uri()`] now returns an [`Origin`].

  * **All items in [`rocket_contrib`] are namespaced behind modules.**

    * `Json` is now `json::Json`
    * `MsgPack` is now `msgpack::MsgPack`
    * `MsgPackError` is now `msgpack::Error`
    * `Template` is now `templates::Template`
    * `UUID` is now `uuid::Uuid`
    * `Value` is replaced by `json::JsonValue`

  * **TLS certificates require the `subjectAltName` extension.**

    Ensure that your TLS certificates contain the `subjectAltName` extension
    with a value set to your domain.

  * **Route paths, mount points, and [`LocalRequest`] URIs are strictly
    checked.**

    Ensure your mount points are absolute paths with no parameters, ensure your
    route paths are absolute paths with proper parameter syntax, and ensure that
    paths passed to `LocalRequest` are valid.

  * **[`Template::show()`] takes an `&Rocket`, doesn't accept a `root`.**

    Use [`client.rocket()`] to get a reference to an instance of `Rocket` when
    testing. Use [`Template::render()`] in routes.

  * **[`Request::remote()`] returns the _actual_ remote IP, doesn't rewrite.**

    Use [`Request::real_ip()`] or [`Request::client_ip()`] to retrieve the IP
    address from the "X-Real-IP" header if it is present.

  * **[`Bind`] variant was added to [`LaunchErrorKind`].**

    Ensure matches on `LaunchErrorKind` include or ignore the `Bind` variant.

  * **Cookies are automatically tracked and propagated by [`Client`].**

    For the previous behavior, construct a `Client` with
    [`Client::untracked()`].

  * **`UUID` was renamed to [`Uuid`].**

    Use `Uuid` instead of `UUID`.

  * **`LocalRequest::cloned_dispatch()` was removed.**

    Chain calls to `.clone().dispatch()` for the previous behavior.

  * **[`Redirect`] constructors take a generic type of `T:
    TryInto<Uri<'static>>`.**

    A call to a `Redirect` constructor with a non-`'static` `&str`  of the form
    `Redirect::to(string)` should become `Redirect::to(string.to_string())`,
    heap-allocating the string before being passed to the constructor.

  * **The [`FromData`] impl for [`Form`] and [`LenientForm`] now return an error
    of type [`FormDataError`].**

    On non-I/O errors, the form string is stored in the variant as an `&'f str`.

  * **[`Missing`] variant was added to [`ConfigError`].**

    Ensure matches on `ConfigError` include or ignore the `Missing` variant.

  * **The [`FromData`] impl for [`Json`] now returns an error of type
    [`JsonError`].**

    The previous `SerdeError` is now the `.1` member of the `JsonError` `enum`.
    Match and destruct the variant for the previous behavior.

  * **[`FromData`] is now emulated by [`FromDataSimple`].**

    Change _implementations_, not uses, of `FromData` to `FromDataSimple`.
    Consider whether your implementation could benefit from [transformations].

  * **[`FormItems`] iterates over values of type [`FormItem`].**

    Map using `.map(|item| item.key_value())` for the previous behavior.

  * **[`LaunchErrorKind::Collision`] contains a vector of the colliding routes.**

    Destruct using `LaunchErrorKind::Collision(..)` to ignore the vector.

  * **[`Request::get_param()`] and [`Request::get_segments()`] are indexed by
    _segment_, not dynamic parameter.**

    Modify the `n` argument in calls to these functions appropriately.

  * **Method-based route attributes no longer accept a keyed `path` parameter.**

    Change an attribute of the form `#[get(path = "..")]` to `#[get("..")]`.

  * **[`Json`] and [`MsgPack`] data guards no longer reject requests with an
    unexpected Content-Type**

    To approximate the previous behavior, add a `format = "json"` route
    parameter when using `Json` or `format = "msgpack"` when using `MsgPack`.

  * **Implemented [`Responder` for `Status`]. Removed `Failure`,
    `status::NoContent`, and `status::Reset` responders.**

    Replace uses of `Failure(status)` with `status` directly. Replace
    `status::NoContent` with `Status::NoContent`. Replace `status::Reset` with
    `Status::ResetContent`.

  * **[`Config::root()`] returns an `Option<&Path>` instead of an `&Path`.**

    For the previous behavior, use `config.root().unwrap()`.

  * **[`Status::new()`] is no longer `const`.**

    Construct a `Status` directly.

  * **[`Config`] constructors return a `Config` instead of a `Result<Config>`.**

  * **`ConfigError::BadCWD`, `Config.config_path` were removed.**

  * **[`Json`] no longer has a default value for its type parameter.**

  * **Using `data` on a non-payload method route is a warning instead of error.**

  * **The `raw_form_string` method of [`Form`] and [`LenientForm`] was
    removed.**

  * **Various impossible `Error` associated types are now set to `!`.**

  * **All [`AdHoc`] constructors require a name as the first parameter.**

  * **The top-level `Error` type was removed.**

  * Private cookies are set to `HttpOnly` and are given an expiration date of 1
    week by default.
  * A [Tera templates example] was added.
  * All macros, derives, and attributes are individually documented in
    [`rocket_codegen`].

## Breaking Changes

This release includes many breaking changes. These changes are listed below
along with a short note about how to handle the breaking change in existing
applications.

  * **`session_key` was renamed to `secret_key`, requires a 256-bit base64 key**

    It's unlikely that `session_key` was previously used. If it was, rename
    `session_key` to `secret_key`. Generate a random 256-bit base64 key using a
    tool like openssl: `openssl rand -base64 32`.

  * **The `&Cookies` request guard has been removed in favor of `Cookies`**

    Change `&Cookies` in a request guard position to `Cookies`.

  * **`Rocket::launch()` now returns a `LaunchError`, doesn't panic.**

    For the old behavior, suffix a call to `.launch()` with a semicolon:
    `.launch();`.

  * **Routes without query parameters match requests with or without query
    parameters.**

    There is no workaround, but this change may allow manual ranks from routes
    to be removed.

  * **The `format` route attribute on non-payload requests matches against the
    Accept header.**

    Excepting a custom request guard, there is no workaround. Previously,
    `format` always matched against the Content-Type header, regardless of
    whether the request method indicated a payload or not.

  * **A type of `&str` can no longer be used in form structures or parameters.**

    Use the new [`&RawStr`] type instead.

  * **`ContentType` is no longer a request guard.**

    Use `&ContentType` instead.

  * **`Request::content_type()` returns `&ContentType` instead of
    `ContentType`.**

    Use `.clone()` on `&ContentType` if a type of `ContentType` is required.

  * **`Response::header_values()` was removed. `Response::headers()` now returns
    an `&HeaderMap`.**

    A call to `Response::headers()` can be replaced with
    `Response::headers().iter()`. A call to `Response::header_values(name)` can
    be replaced with `Response::headers().get(name)`.

  * **Route collisions result in a hard error and panic.**

    There is no workaround. Previously, route collisions were a warning.

  * **The [`IntoOutcome`] trait has been expanded and made more flexible.**

    There is no workaround. `IntoOutcome::into_outcome()` now takes a `Failure`
    value to use. `IntoOutcome::or_forward()` was added to return a `Forward`
    outcome if `self` indicates an error.

  * **The 'testing' feature was removed.**

    Remove `features = ["testing"]` from `Cargo.toml`. Use the new [`local`]
    module for testing.

  * **`serde` was updated to 1.0.**

    There is no workaround. Ensure all dependencies rely on `serde` `1.0`.

  * **`config::active()` was removed.**

    Use [`Rocket::config()`] to retrieve the configuration before launch. If
    needed, use [managed state] to store config information for later use.

  * **The [`Responder`] trait has changed.**

    `Responder::respond(self)` was removed in favor of
    `Responder::respond_to(self, &Request)`. Responders may dynamically adjust
    their response based on the incoming request.

  * **`Outcome::of(Responder)` was removed while `Outcome::from(&Request,
    Responder)` was added.**

    Use `Outcome::from(..)` instead of `Outcome::of(..)`.

  * **Usage of templates requires `Template::fairing()` to be attached.**

    Call `.attach(Template::fairing())` on the application's Rocket instance
    before launching.

  * **The `Display` implementation of `Template` was removed.**

    Use [`Template::show()`] to render a template directly.

  * **`Request::new()` is no longer exported.**

    There is no workaround.

  * **The [`FromForm`] trait has changed.**

    `Responder::from_form_items(&mut FormItems)` was removed in favor of
    `Responder::from_form(&mut FormItems, bool)`. The second parameter indicates
    whether parsing should be strict (if `true`) or lenient (if `false`).

  * **`LoggingLevel` was removed as a root reexport.**

    It can now be imported from `rocket::config::LoggingLevel`.

  * **An `Io` variant was added to [`ConfigError`].**

    Ensure `match`es on `ConfigError` include an `Io` variant.

  * **[`ContentType::from_extension()`] returns an `Option<ContentType>`.**

    For the old behvavior, use `.unwrap_or(ContentType::Any)`.

  * **The `IntoValue` config trait was removed in favor of `Into<Value>`.**

    There is no workaround. Use `Into<Value>` as necessary.

  * **The `rocket_contrib::JSON` type has been renamed to
    [`rocket_contrib::Json`].**

    Use `Json` instead of `JSON`.

  * **All structs in the [`content`] module use TitleCase names.**

    Use `Json`, `Xml`, `Html`, and `Css` instead of `JSON`, `XML`, `HTML`, and
    `CSS`, respectively.

  * Logging can be enabled or disabled on custom configuration via a second
    parameter to the `Rocket::custom` method.
  * `name` and `value` methods were added to `Header` to retrieve the name and
    value of a header.
  * A new configuration parameter, `workers`, can be used to set the number of
    threads Rocket uses.
  * The address of the remote connection is available via `Request.remote()`.
    Request preprocessing overrides remote IP with value from the `X-Real-IP`
    header, if present.
  * During testing, the remote address can be set via `MockRequest.remote()`.
  * The `SocketAddr` request guard retrieves the remote address.
  * A `UUID` type has been added to `contrib`.
  * `rocket` and `rocket_codegen` will refuse to build with an incompatible
    nightly version and emit nice error messages.
  * Major performance and usability improvements were upstreamed to the `cookie`
    crate, including the addition of a `CookieBuilder`.
  * When a checkbox isn't present in a form, `bool` types in a `FromForm`
    structure will parse as `false`.
  * The `FormItems` iterator can be queried for a complete parse via `completed`
    and `exhausted`.
  * Routes for `OPTIONS` requests can be declared via the `options` decorator.
  * Strings can be percent-encoded via `URI::percent_encode()`.

## Breaking Changes

This release includes several breaking changes. These changes are listed below
along with a short note about how to handle the breaking change in existing
applications.

  * **`Rocket::custom` takes two parameters, the first being `Config` by
    value.**

    A call in v0.1 of the form `Rocket::custom(&config)` is now
    `Rocket::custom(config, false)`.

  * **Tera templates are named without their extension.**

    A templated named `name.html.tera` is now simply `name`.

  * **`JSON` `unwrap` method has been renamed to `into_inner`.**

    A call to `.unwrap()` should be changed to `.into_inner()`.

  * **The `map!` macro was removed in favor of the `json!` macro.**

    A call of the form `map!{ "a" => b }` can be written as: `json!({ "a": b
    })`.

  * **The `hyper::SetCookie` header is no longer exported.**

    Use the `Cookie` type as an `Into<Header>` type directly.

  * **The `Content-Type` for `String` is now `text/plain`.**

    Use `content::HTML<String>` for HTML-based `String` responses.

  * **`Request.content_type()` returns an `Option<ContentType>`.**

    Use `.unwrap_or(ContentType::Any)` to get the old behavior.

  * **The `ContentType` request guard forwards when the request has no
    `Content-Type` header.**

    Use an `Option<ContentType>` and `.unwrap_or(ContentType::Any)` for the old
    behavior.

  * **A `Rocket` instance must be declared _before_ a `MockRequest`.**

    Change the order of the `rocket::ignite()` and `MockRequest::new()` calls.

  * **A route with `format` specified only matches requests with the same
    format.**

    Previously, a route with a `format` would match requests without a format
    specified. There is no workaround to this change; simply specify formats
    when required.

  * **`FormItems` can no longer be constructed directly.**

    Instead of constructing as `FormItems(string)`, construct as
    `FormItems::from(string)`.

  * **`from_from_string(&str)` in `FromForm` removed in favor of
    `from_form_items(&mut FormItems)`.**

    Most implementation should be using `FormItems` internally; simply use the
    passed in `FormItems`. In other cases, the form string can be retrieved via
    the `inner_str` method of `FormItems`.

  * **`Config::{set, default_for}` are deprecated.**

    Use the `set_{param}` methods instead of `set`, and `new` or `build` in
    place of `default_for`.

  * **Route paths must be absolute.**

    Prepend a `/` to convert a relative path into an absolute one.

  * **Route paths cannot contain empty segments.**

    Remove any empty segments, including trailing ones, from a route path.

## Bug Fixes

A couple of bugs were fixed in this release:

  * Handlebars partials were not properly registered
    ([#122](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/122)).
  * `Rocket::custom` did not set the custom configuration as the `active`
    configuration.
  * Route path segments containing more than one dynamic parameter were
    allowed.

## General Improvements

In addition to new features, Rocket saw the following smaller improvements:

  * Rocket no longer overwrites a catcher's response status.
  * The `port` `Config` type is now a proper `u16`.
  * Clippy issues injected by codegen are resolved.

  * The `PartialEq` implementation of `Config` doesn't consider the path or
    secret key.

  * Tera has been updated to `0.7`.
  * `pub(crate)` is used throughout to enforce visibility rules.
  * Query parameters in routes (`/path?<param>`) are now logged.
  * Routes with and without query parameters no longer _collide_.
